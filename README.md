# Call Centre Report Analysis-2023(Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
To evaluate and improve the operational performance of the call centre in year 2023 by analyzing key metrics such as call volumes, service levels, agent productivity, and customer satisfaction. The goal is to identify trends, uncover inefficiencies, and enhance the overall customer experience through data-driven insights.

## Questions addressed(KPIs)
- •	What are the trends in call volumes, both weekly and monthy?
- •	Are we consistently meeting service levels?
- •	How efficient are our agents (AHT)?
- •	Are customers satisfied (CSAT trends)?
- •	Who are our top and bottom performing agents and percentage of calls handled and amount related to them?
- •	What are the most common call outcomes?
- •	How do gender demographics differ across countries?
- •	Which countries and customers contribute most to revenue?

## Process
- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies,and sort out the same.
- made sure that date is consistent and clean wrt data type, data format and values use.
- created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.

## Insights from Dashboard
- August & September had the highest call volume (>1,800 calls).
- October had the highest AHT (~9.5 mins); May had the lowest (~6 mins).
- Service level dropped to 72% in July; peaked above 85% in March & November.
- Abandonment rate peaked at ~9% in July & October; lowest in February (~3%).
- FCR dropped to 76% in October; peaked at 89% in March & June.
- CSAT was lowest in October (82%) and highest in April/September (90%).
- Agent A had top FCR and CSAT; Agent C had lowest performance.
- 64% of calls were resolved; 25% required transfer or callback.
- Country A: Female callers ~60% – suggests service messaging can be women-focused.
- Country B: Balanced 50-50 split – generalist support strategies are appropriate.
- Country C: Male callers ~65% – male-dominated communication may be more effective.
- Country X (e.g., USA) shows highest spend, with several customers >$1,000.
- Country Y (e.g., UK): Moderate, consistent spend – ideal for retention strategies.
- Country Z (e.g., India): Lower per-customer spend, higher volume – potential for scaling.
- Top spenders: John Doe, Sarah Lee, Priya Sharma ($1,200–$1,500+).

- ## Summary
•	• October was the most challenging month (low CSAT, high AHT & abandonment).
•	• March, April & June performed best across metrics.
•	• Agent A and E are top performers.
•	• Training opportunity identified for Agent C.
•	• FCR, CSAT, and AHT are tightly linked—improving one may influence others.
